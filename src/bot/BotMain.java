/**
 * This is a simple bot that does random (but correct) moves.
 * This class implements the Bot interface and overrides its Move methods.
 * You can implement these methods yourself very easily now,
 * since you can retrieve all information about the match from variable â€œstateâ€�.
 * When the bot decided on the move to make, it returns an ArrayList of Moves.
 * The bot is started by creating a Parser to which you add
 * a new instance of your bot, and then the parser is started.
